**Step 1: Audio Preprocessing**

Convert input audio (from video/raw) into mono.

Resample to 16kHz.

Save as .wav for Whisper compatibility.

**Step 2: Video to Audio Extraction**

Use FFmpeg to extract audio track.

Save as .wav.

Ensure Whisperâ€™s format requirements.

**Step 3: Real-Time Streaming Transcription**

Split audio into small chunks.

Stream chunks to Whisper for transcription.

Update captions continuously with minimal latency.

**Step 4: ASR Model Setup**

Initialize Whisper ASR (openai-whisper).

Configure language & transcription mode.

Optimize with GPU acceleration if available.
